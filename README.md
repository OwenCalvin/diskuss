# Diskuss

Diskuss is a Node.js chat server that offers an API but no official client.

## install

1. This application requires **[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)** and **NPM** (included with Node.js), please install it if you haven't.
2. From the directory where `server.js` is located, use the command line `npm install` to download and install dependencies.
3. Run the server with `node server.js`.
4. Open a browser (or IE if you don't have any) and connect to your server on port 8081. If you access that address from the same computer as the one you started the server on, simply follow **[this link](http://127.0.0.1:8081)**. The description of the API is located at the root of the application.
